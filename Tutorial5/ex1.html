    <p2>What Kind of Fish Works Best With This Batter?<br></br>
        Use a thick white fish for this recipe; sustainable cod, haddock, or pollock are preferable. The batter includes both dark beer and sparkling water. The carbonation in the beer and sparkling water and the type of fish suggested ensures a light, mild, tender outcome, which is perfect for crispy fish and chips.</p2>

    <p3>Here are the indgredients that you will need to start with in order to proceed into making a dish like this!</p3>
    <br>
    <p4>First off, we will start with the fish, and how to batter it properly. Follow this step by step to create the proper batter for the fish.</p4>
    <ol>
        <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons (55 grams) cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Fine salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cold dark beer</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cold sparkling water</li>
        <li>4 (7-ounce) thick, white fish fillets</li>
    </ol>
    <br></br>
    <p20><b>Step 1:</b> <br> Set aside 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour with 7 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 teaspoon baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of fine salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p20>

    <br><br>
    <p21><b>Step 2:</b> <br> Using a fork to whisk continuously, add 1/3 cup cold dark beer and 1/3 cup cold sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p21>

    <br><br>
    <p22><b>Step 3:</b><br> Meanwhile, lay 4 (7-ounce) thick, white fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little salt.</p22>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <p23><b>Step 4:</b> <br>Heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350 F in a deep-fryer or large, deep saucepan. Par-cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil, about 2 minutes (do not brown them). Remove the chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. Set aside.</p23>

    <br><br>
    <p24><b>Step 5:</b> <br>Place the 2 tablespoons of reserved flour into a shallow bowl. Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.</p24>

    <br><br>
    <p25><b>Step 6:</b> <br>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet.</p25>

    <br><br>
    <p26><b>Step 7:</b> <br>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 200 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Bring the oil temperature back to 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. Fry until the batter is crisp and golden, turning the fillets occasionally with a large slotted spoon, 6 to 8 minutes.</p26>

    <br><br>
    <p27><b>Step 8:</b> <br>Remove the fillets from the oil to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt and transfer to the oven to keep warm.</p27>

    <p7>Now, we have to start with the chips! <br> This seems pretty straight forward, your local store will sell frozen chips and you can even cook it with an air fryer. <br> However, if you still want to do it the traditional way, by all means</p7>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, as needed for frying</li>
    </ol>
    <p6>If you are unsure as to how to make fries, here is a very good video </p6><br><br>

    <h3>Some tips to take note!</h3>
    <br>
    <p7>The fish and potatoes need to be dry. 
        <br>Removing moisture produces crispier fried food and reduces oil splatter. Oil temperature is also key. If it's too cool, the food needs to cook longer, will soak up more oil, and become soggy. 
        <br>You also don't want it too hot because that can lead to a burnt batter or undercooked fish and potatoes. When deep-frying in a pan, use a thermometer to monitor and maintain the oil temperature.
        <br>Avoid overcrowding the pan. Putting too many pieces of fish or potatoes in the pan will lower the oil's temperature, resulting in soggy food.
